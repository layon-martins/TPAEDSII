ropper: a placement and routing framework for field-coupled 
nanotechnologies field-coupled nanocomputing technologies are 
the subject of extensive research to overcome current cmos limitations. 
these technologies include nanomagnetic and quantum structures, each with its 
design and synchronization challenges. in this scenario clocking schemes are 
used to ensure circuit synchronization and avoid signal disruptions at the 
cost of some area overhead. unfortunatelly, a nanocomputing technology is 
limited to a small subset of clocking schemes due to its number of clocking 
phases and signal propagation system, thus, leading to complex design challenges 
when tackling the placement and routing problem resulting in technology dependant solutions. 
our work consists on presenting a novel framework developed by our team that solves these 
design challenges when using distinct schemes, therefore, avoiding the need to design 
pre-defined routing algorithms for each one. the framework offers a technology independent 
solution and provides interfaces for the implementation of efficient and scalable placement 
strategies, moreover, it has full integration with reference state-of-the-art optimization 
and synthesis tools.
