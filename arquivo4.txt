migrating a system for event participation assistance to the microservices 
architecture monolithic architecture systems, which are systems composed of a 
single logical and executable unit, are, in general, hard to scale once any 
modification made in a small part of the system requires it to be rebuilt and 
redeployed as a whole. one way to ease this aspect, which is even more problematic in 
bigger information systems,is to follow modern low cost architecture proposals, as the 
one that advises the microservices usage. however, migrating legacy monolithic systems 
specifically to the microservice scenario is a challenging task, with proposals and 
background still incipient within the literature. this work consists of a migration 
proposal o the microservice rchitecture of a monolithic system for event participation 
assistance and the comparison of the software quality between the resulting product 
and the old version. for the migration results study and evaluation it was applied 
the metrics lines of code, comments rate, time of features conclusion and rework rate, those 
points to a maintainability degradation caused by the monolith complexity, which doesn’t 
happen so steeply in the microservice architecture. after all, it is concluded that the 
microservice architecture adoption contributed to increased team expectation,development 
efficiency, good practices usage inducement, test development ease and speed of feature 
release to production (time to market).
