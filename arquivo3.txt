analyzing the impact of bots during the 2018 brazilian presidential 
election based on youtube comments the tendency of discussing politics 
in online social networks (osns) has become increasingly growing, especially 
in election periods. this growth may be justified by the little restrictive 
format of the information to be published and also by many politicians 
conducting their respective campaigns on these networks due to the limitation 
of the free political advertising time. according to this trend and to the 
large amount of data generated by users of these social networks, the objective of 
this work is to analyze the impact of bots during the candidacy of fernando haddad 
and jair messias bolsonaro in the brazilian presidential election of 2018 and,additionally, their 
possible voters, by using comments collected from youtube. our results 
demonstrate that, considering all the unique users of the collected 
data set, approximately 71.44% of them were considered undecided, 17.67% as potential 
bolsonaro voters and 10.89% as potential haddad voters, with no evidence of political 
manipulation by bots.
