improving rule based and equivalent decision simplifications 
for bloat control in genetic programming using a dynamic operator 
bloat is a common issue regarding genetic programming (gp), specially noted 
in symbolic regression (sr) problems. due to this, gp tends to generate a huge 
amount of ineffective code that could be avoided or removed. code editing is one 
of many approaches to avoid bloat. the objective in this strategy is to mutate or 
remove subtrees which do not contribute to the final solution. two known methods of 
redundant code removal, the rule based simplification (rbs) and equivalent decision 
simplification (eds) are extended in a new operator presented in this paper, called 
dynamic operator with rbs and eds (dore). this operator gives the algebraic 
simplification table used byrbs the potential to learn from reductions performed by eds. 
an initial benchmark highlighted how the rbs table can grow as much as 86% with dore, and 
reducing the time spent on simplification by 16.83%. experiments with the other three sr problems were performed showing
a considerable improvement on fitness of the generated programs, besides a 
slight reduction in the population of the average tree size.
