sendas: scalable enrichment for mobility 
data sets recent years of technological 
advancement and popularization hasgrown 
the availability of mobility data, collected 
from different sources. analyzing such data is an 
active research and industrial development field, 
with a diverse range of applications. however, trajectory 
data has also been following the big data trend, 
and currently existing tools lack of scalability. 
to cover this gap, we introduce sendas – scalable enrichment for 
mobility data sets –, a new scala library built around the apache spark 
framework, enabling parallel and distributed execution for mobility analysis techniques. 
we present definitions that extend state-of-the-art notions of trajectory naming, 
flow calculation and mobility motifidentification, and also conduct comparative 
performance evaluation, finding running time improvements of 4 to 6 times when 
compared to non-parallel execution.
